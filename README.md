Some useful helpers functions when working with Laravel JSON data. There is a lot of things that should be done:
    - additional JSON manipulation functions
    - move code to workbench, in order to create package
    - testing,testing,testingo
    - deploy to packagist

This is just a bootstrap for future work.
